!!! This needs vagrant 0.8.x !!!


This Vagrant setup can be used to test Percona XtraDB Cluster (Percona Server with Galera)

This is used with Centos 6 x86_64, the base box used has multiple interface, eth3 is the nic used for the galera replication.
That base box can be retrieved on http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11697684/centos6.box.bz2


How to use ?

vagrant up percona1
vagrant up percona2
vagrant up percona3

And this is all, you have now 3 servers running Percona XtraDB Cluster !


Note: SElinux is disabled, there is a selinux policy file included that allows the server to start but the other nodes aren't yet able to sync, I need to investigate...
